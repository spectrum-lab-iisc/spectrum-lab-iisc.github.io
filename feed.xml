The objective is to overcome the limitations in standard analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) where the dynamic range is fixed: signal that lies outside the fixed dynamic range saturates.</p> <p class="text-justify">Unlimited sampling is an important problem in addressing signal representation in practical systems and has applications in almost all imaging systems. We propose a new technique for unlimited sampling using a neuromorphic encoder. Our system is power efficient, simple to implement in practice, and most importantly, does not require oversampling.</p> <h2 id="computational-modulo-sampling">Computational Modulo Sampling</h2> <p class="text-justify">Computational modulo sampling is a framework for unlimted sampling that uses a self-reset ADC (SR-ADC) as opposed to a standard ADC, where a continuous-time signal \(f(t)\) is first folded using the continuous-domain modulo operator before acquisition. The idea of computational unlimited sampling was first proposed by <a href="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~ayush/usf.html">Dr Ayush Bhandari</a>, currently at Imperial College London. The continuous-time modulo operator with parameter \(\lambda\) is defined as</p> \[f\mapsto \mathcal{M}_{\lambda}\{f\} = 2\lambda\left[\frac{f}{2\lambda}+\frac{1}{2}\right]-\lambda,\] <p class="text-justify">where \([\cdot]\) defines the fractional part of the argument. The modulo operator restricts the dynamic range to the interval \([-\lambda,+\lambda]\) and enables acquisition of high-dynamic range (in principle, unlimited) acquisition.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/spectrum-website/assets/img/nus/mod-encoder.png" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/spectrum-website/assets/img/nus/mod-encoder.png" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Fig. 1: What happens in a computational unlimited sampling setup. </div> <p class="text-justify">Reconstruction of the high-dynamic range signal from samples of \(\mathcal{M}_{\lambda}\{f\}\) requires oversampling as compared to the Nyquist rate of \(f\). Further, for practical deployment of unlimited sampling, specialised hardware is required. This can indeed be a practical bottleneck! Oversampling is expensive, and adds to the cost of replacing the existing standard ADC with a self-reset ADC. Our solution addresses this problem and is as simple as using a nonlinear filter before acquisition!</p> <h2 id="the-neuromorphic-unlimited-sampling-framework">The <strong>Neuromorphic Unlimited Sampling</strong> Framework</h2> <p class="text-justify">At the heart of our solution is the neuromorphic encoder, which is a bio-inspired acquisition device that has been successfully deployed in making efficient video acquisition systems. For more on neuromorphic video acquisition, check out the work from the <a href="https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/index.html">Robotics and Perception Group</a>.</p> <p class="text-justify">Neuromorphic encoders are opportunistic devices that record signals as a stream of events that denote a change in the input by a constant. The signal is represented as a sequence of 2-tuples, each constituting the time instant and the polarity of change.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-12 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/spectrum-website/assets/img/nus/nus-encoder.jpeg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/spectrum-website/assets/img/nus/nus-encoder.jpeg" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Fig. 2: Schematic of a neuromorphic encoder.

The key observation for unlimited sampling is that the difference signal \(v(t)\) is a folded version of the input signal \(f(t)\), and is completely accommodated in the range \([-\lambda, +\lambda]\). In essence, the signal \(v(t)\) is a polarity dependent modulo operator acting on the input signal as</p> \[f\mapsto v = \mathcal{F}_\lambda\{f\}.\] <p>The in-built folding in the neuromorphic encoder along with its opportunistic nature makes it a perfect fit for unlimited sampling.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-12 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/spectrum-website/assets/img/nus/nus-schematic.jpeg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/spectrum-website/assets/img/nus/nus-schematic.jpeg" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Fig. 3: Unlimited sampling using a neuromorphic encoder: The accompanying ADC operates at the Nyquist rate and at full precision. The error incurred due to folding is tracked using the neuromorphic encoder allowing real-time reconstruction. </div> <p class="text-justify">Similar to modulo sampling, the error signal \(f(t)-v(t)\) is a piecewise constant signal with amplitude quantised to multiples of \(\lambda\). In computational modulo sampling, the error signal is estimated from <em>oversampled</em> measurements of the folded signal using the repeated finite-difference algorithm. In neuromorphic unlimited sampling, the error signal is captured succinctly using the output of the neuromorphic encoder as</p> \[\eta_f(t) = \sum_m \lambda\mathcal{S}\{p_m\} 1_{[t_m,t_{m+1}]}(t),\] <p class="text-justify">where \(\mathcal{S}\) denotes the cumulative summation operator. Therefore, no oversampling is required! Uniform samples of the folded signal \(v\) captures the high-dynamic-range information in the input signal, achieving unlimited sampling!</p> <p class="text-justify">Additional measurements are made using the neuromorphic encoder opportunistically, i.e., only when the signal goes beyond the dynamic range while consuming much less power than the ADC. We also show that the maximal rate of additional measurements that may be obtained decays with the dynamic range. Our perfect reconstruction strategy only requires addition of a residual signal constructed using the compressed representation of the error signal, which can be achieved in real time.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-9 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/spectrum-website/assets/img/nus/nus-demo.png" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/spectrum-website/assets/img/nus/nus-demo.png" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Fig. 4: Demonstration of neuromorphic sampling and perfect reconstruction. </div> <p class="text-justify">Our patented unlimited sampling hardware using simple and cost-effective components in-house <d-cite key="kulur2024neuromorphic"></d-cite>. The neuromorphic unlimited sampling scheme is such that the neuromorphic encoder can be plugged into an existing acquisition system to achieve unlimited sampling, akin to a prefilter typically used in sampling, and does not require specialised hardware such as the self-reset ADC. In hardware, we demonstrate HDR acquisition and real-time reconstruction of synthetic signals. We show that neuromorphic unlimited sampling operates at the Nyquist rate of the signal, while opportunistically recording compressed measurements. Our demonstration was presented at the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP) 2024, in Seoul Korea 2024, in the Show-and-tell Demos <d-cite key="kulur2024modulo"></d-cite>.
